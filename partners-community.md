# Community: In-kind donations & services üåê

**Support Open Source Learners - contribute to our GitSkilled Developer Pack** through in-kind donations, workshops, or mentorship, equipping learners with real-world open-source experience. Become a Community Partner and help our GitSkilled community of learners develop the skills needed to become successful tech innovators and leaders.\
## Why It Matters
- **Supporting Socially Conscious Developers** ‚Äì We empower talented individuals - both technical and nontechnical -  who lack access to well-resourced institutions.
- **Building Open Source Careers** ‚Äì Beyond education, we offer career development to help developers launch successful open-source careers.


## What Makes the GitHub GitSkilled Community Developer Pack Different?

Through the **GitHub GitSkilled** initiative, we aim to provide a broad range of learners‚Äîfrom beginners to experienced developers‚Äîwith the skills they need to thrive in the open-source ecosystem. This project expands access to students who are not traditionally eligible for the GitHub Student Developer Pack

- **Supporting Non-Traditional Learners** ‚Äì Unlike the Student Developer Pack, this initiative reaches learners beyond well-resourced universities‚Äîthose in global bootcamps, small colleges, educational nonprofits, and alternative learning paths who often have fewer resources but just as much talent.
- **Empowering Careers in Open Source** ‚Äì The GitHub GitSkilled Program goes beyond education, offering professional and career development to help these developers launch successful open-source careers.
Because of this, the criteria for donations‚Äîboth digital and virtual‚Äîare broader than those for the Student Developer Pack.

We‚Äôd love to include your offering in this initiative and give you the opportunity to directly impact the next generation of tech talent worldwide.
