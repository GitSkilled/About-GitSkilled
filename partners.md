# Partner with GitSkilled

## Empowering the next generation of open source talent


The GitSkilled Community is dedicated to providing educational, professional development, and personal growth opportunities to underrepresented and marginalized communities seeking careers in open source and tech. Our community thrives on support from our valued partners, and this page outlines how organizations can engage with us to make a meaningful impact. There are three types of partnerships available:

   - [Sponsorship](https://github.com/GitSkilled/About-GitSkilled/blob/main/partners-sponsorship.md)
