# Partner with GitSkilled

## Empowering the next generation of open source talent


The GitSkilled Community is dedicated to providing educational, professional development, and personal growth opportunities to underrepresented and marginalized communities seeking careers in open source and tech. Our community thrives on support from our valued partners, and this page outlines how organizations can engage with us to make a meaningful impact. There are three types of partnerships available:

   - [Sponsorship](https://github.com/All-In-Open-Source-Project/About-All-In/blob/main/partners-sponsorship.md)
   - [Community](https://github.com/All-In-Open-Source-Project/About-All-In/blob/main/partners-community.md)
   - [Education](https://github.com/All-In-Open-Source-Project/About-All-In/blob/main/partners-education.md)

Become a partner to shape the future of open source by providing learners with critical resources, career opportunities, and the tools they need to thrive. Aside from supporting the GitSkilled initiative to further their mission, partners will have access to the benefits in the Partner Pack as listed in the above documents.



## Target Regions:

We are particularly focused on reaching learners in **Africa**, **Europe**, **LatAm**, and **North America** as part of the **GitHub All In** initiative. These regions represent high-growth potential and areas where we can address local skills gaps while supporting long-term tech and economic development.

## How You Can Get Involved:

If you are interested in partnering with **GitSkilled** to scale skilling initiatives and provide life-changing learning opportunities, we would love to hear from you. Together, we can help empower developers, break down barriers to opportunity, and build an inclusive, thriving tech ecosystem.
