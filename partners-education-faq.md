At this time, the GitSkilled curriculum is only available through Microsoft Learn and YouTube to ensure consistent updates and quality control. While full integration into external platforms is not currently an option, we are actively exploring solutions that will allow education partners to embed our curriculum into their Learning Management Systems (LMS) in the future.

Yes! The GitSkilled curriculum is self-paced, allowing organizations to integrate it into their workforce development or mentorship programs on a timeline that suits their learners.

Organizations can recommend these sessions as part of their existing programs.
