**Partner with Us to Help Scale GitSkilled**
GitSkilled is committed to working with skilling organizations to build strong, local communities that empower learners by providing tailored support and resources to help them thrive in open source. Here are some of the benefits your community of learners will gain through your partnership with GitSkilled via our GitSkilled Developer Pack.

## Why Partner with GitSkilled?

Through the **GitSkilled** initiative, we aim to provide a broad range of learnersâ€”from beginners to experienced developersâ€”with the skills they need to thrive in the open-source ecosystem. Partners who join us will have the opportunity to upskill their learners in key technologies such as:

- **GitHub Basics** â€“ Offering foundational knowledge of GitHub, version control, and collaboration in open-source projects.
- **GitHub Copilot** â€“ Enabling developers to boost productivity and innovation by learning how to use GitHub Copilot effectively.
- **Responsible AI** â€“ Providing critical education on building and using AI technologies responsibly.

Our goal is to collaborate with partners who share our passion for fostering inclusive, diverse, and sustainable developer communities. Whether you're an educational institution, nonprofit organization, or a company with a workforce development program, there are multiple ways to get involved with **GitSkilled**.

## Ways to Get Involved:

- **Co-Create Learning Paths:** Collaborate with us to develop localized or specialized learning content tailored to the needs of your audience, whether theyâ€™re just starting out or are experienced professionals looking to deepen their expertise.
- **Direct your Learners to MS Learn** By completing the GitHub Foundations course on MS Learn, your learners will be able to join our community and gain access to the GitSkilled Developer Pack.
- **Host Skilling Events:** Partner with us to organize hackathons, workshops, or webinars focused on GitHub technologies, GitHub Copilot, and Ethical AI to enhance your learners' skills.
